# srlua_5.1_windows_x86
Self-runnable Lua 5.1 pre-compiled binaries for Windows, for building Lua scripts into executable files. 

DISCLAIMER: this is not my code, and I do not take credit for it. I'm uploading these binaries since the original source is no longer available (through conventional means), compiling from source is not possible on Windows (at the moment); and many Windows users (like me, who enjoy Lua) will find these tools of great use in their own projects.
